                    <h2>Jupiter:</h2>
                    <h3>Leverage:</h3>
                    <p>The third key element in striking the perfect recipe for personal balance is Leverage. Justlike
                        the planet Jupiter, which is known for expansion, growth, luck, and consequential
                        productivity, it’s essential to leverage the tools and productivity hacks to work smarter and
                        get time back. So, I invite you to ponder, where are you spending time needlessly? Are
                        there tasks that seem to drag on that could be delegated? Or is there perhaps a resource
                        or tool you could explore to simplify a particularly draining task?</p>

                    <h3>Engage in YOU:</h3>
                    <p>The seventh key element in finding and maintaining your optimum balance is Engagement
                        in YOU. Just as Mars is the ruling planet of decisive action, it is time for you to take a fiery
                        step in self-acceptance and love. It’s time to start putting yourself first...guilt free. Let me
                        say that again, it’s time to put YOU first. NO guilt. So, ask yourself. Where are you putting
                        others first? What would truly putting you — your needs, your dreams, your wants — first
                        look like? What boundaries need to be placed to do so? How can you remind yourself to
                        do this when you forget?</p>

                    <h2>Mercury</h2>
                    <h3>Narrate: </h3>
                    <p>The fifth key element of true, authentic balance is Narration. In addition to rooting out old
                        ways of thinking and forming new habits (as the Moon + fourth key element instruct us), it’s
                        essential that we develop and believe in a narrative we can get behind. This can mean
                        shifting the mission statement of our business, the way we market it, or even the narrative
                        we tell to ourselves about ourselves and our ability to show-up (both soulfully and
                        strategically). So, just as Mercury rules over communication, we must be the rulers of our
                        own stories and tell them to ourselves in others in a way that uplifts, inspires, and
                        encourages. So, what stories are you currently telling yourself about yourself? How do they
                        make you feel? And what story is your business currently telling to others? Is it an accurate
                        one?</p>

                <div class="card-4-desc" style="display:none;">
                    <h2>Moon</h2>
                    <h3>Align: </h3>
                    <p>The fourth key element in establishing the most rewarding state of personal balance is
                        Alignment. Just in the way the Moon is said to rule over your intuition, emotions, and
                        interior landscape, our thoughts, emotions, and beliefs dictate the habits, routines, and
                        patterns we form. So, if your emotional relationships with any aspects of your life and
                        business, from money mindset (and the conversations or monetizations associated with it)
                        to your own personal missions, are mis-aligned, the manifestations of those things will be,
                        too. This is where it becomes essential to adhere to a mindset that helps you build
                        positive, self-improving and affirming habits. What areas of your work or life currently feel
                        misaligned with your dream vision? What habits have you formed that feel a bit self-
                        sabotaging? What do you think would improve them?</p>

            <div class="card-5-desc" style="display:none;">
                <h2>Saturn:</h2>
                <h3>Boundaries:</h3>
                <p>The first key element in achieving a healthy, sustainable state of balance is Boundaries. The
                    art of saying no helps prevent things like over-commitment, over-extending, and the
                    consequential overwhelm. Having a strong mindset and approach to your time, like Saturn
                    (known as the ‘teacher’ planet that imposes strict lessons and strength to carry them
                    through), can help in both your soulful and strategic endeavours. Journal questions to
                    explore this further is: Where have I set healthy boundaries? Where do I feel over-
                    extended? How can I set and enforce boundaries in those areas? What does it feel like
                    when a boundary is crossed?</p>

                <div class="card-6-desc" style="display:none;">
                    <h2>Sun</h2>
                    <h3>Assess:</h3>
                    <p>The second key element in finding and maintaining your optimum balance is Assessment.
                        Regular reflection and setting clear mission goals and steps for yourself is at the heart of
                        turning a dream into a reality. So, just the way the sun shines a light on your day, I invite
                        you to illuminate your true goal by asking yourself, what does a true state of balance look
                        like for you? What might it take to get there? How can you break that down further into
                        actionable steps? And how can you reward yourself for your progress along the way?</p>

                    <h2>Venus:</h2>
                    <h3>Community:</h3>
                    <p>The first key element in achieving a healthy, sustainable state of balance is Community.
                        You might be the sole person running your business, but life (and work) are not meant to
                        be done in isolation. Just as Venus, planet of love, beauty, and connection, is a symbol of
                        the importance of finding your tribe, every mentor you admire is a symbol of the great
                        work that happens when you find the right support and accountability. No success hasever
                        happened in a vacuum. So whether it’s the soulful or strategic components of your
                        life and work that need tending, don’t be afraid to actively seek mentorship and
                        accountability. The right people around you truly make all the difference and give you the
                        momentum you need to achieve that perfect balance recipe. So, who in your life (or that
                        you’ve encountered in books or online) makes you feel seen, heard, encouraged? Who
                        gives you positive energy or keeps you accountable to your goals? How can you
                        intentionally seek out and surround yourself with more of this type of support?</p>
